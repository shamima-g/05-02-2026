## INTAKE Phase — Gather Requirements and Produce FRS

**Purpose:** Gather project requirements from the user and produce a comprehensive Feature Requirements Specification (FRS) and intake manifest. Two agents run sequentially:

1. **intake-agent** — Orchestrator welcomes user and routes between "share docs" (Option A), "prototype import" (Option B), or "guided Q&A" (Option C) paths; scans `documentation/`, asks checklist questions (with project context), produces the intake manifest
2. **intake-brd-review-agent** — Reviews requirements for completeness against the FRS template, asks clarifying questions, produces the canonical FRS

## Agent Stages and Key Files

### Stage 1: intake-agent

- **Agent:** `.claude/agents/intake-agent.md`
- **Input:** `documentation/` (read-only — user-provided specs, wireframes, sample data)
- **Output:** `generated-docs/context/intake-manifest.json`
- **Process:** Orchestrator welcome + routing → (Option A: user adds docs / Option B: prototype import / Option C: user describes project) → scan docs → return findings to orchestrator → orchestrator asks checklist questions → produce manifest → orchestrator gets approval → hand off to stage 2

### Stage 2: intake-brd-review-agent

- **Agent:** `.claude/agents/intake-brd-review-agent.md`
- **Input:** `documentation/`, `generated-docs/context/intake-manifest.json`, `.claude/templates/feature-requirements.md`
- **Output:** `generated-docs/specs/feature-requirements.md` (canonical FRS), amended `generated-docs/context/intake-manifest.json`
- **Process:** Read inputs → review against FRS template → return gap analysis to orchestrator → orchestrator asks clarifying questions → produce FRS → orchestrator gets approval → commit → transition to DESIGN

## Determining Current Stage After Compaction

Check these files to determine where you are:

| Manifest exists? | FRS exists? | Current stage |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| No | No | **Stage 1** — Resume intake-agent: scan `documentation/`, ask checklist questions, produce manifest |
| Yes | No | **Stage 2** — Resume intake-brd-review-agent: read manifest + docs, review against FRS template, produce FRS |
| Yes | Yes | **INTAKE complete** — Both agents finished. Check with user if any additional information or context is needed before proceeding to DESIGN |

**File paths to check:**
- Manifest: `generated-docs/context/intake-manifest.json`
- FRS: `generated-docs/specs/feature-requirements.md`

### Resuming Stage 1 (intake-agent) — via scoped calls

No manifest exists yet. If the onboarding routing (welcome + Option A/B/C choice) hasn't happened yet, start there first (see start.md Step 3). If you cannot determine whether routing has happened (e.g. after context compaction), check `workflow-state.json` for an `intakeRoute` field or the existence of any files in `generated-docs/`; if neither provides a clue, re-ask the user which path they'd like. Otherwise, resume using the scoped-call pattern (see start.md Step 4a):
- **Call A:** Scan documentation/, return structured findings
- **Orchestrator:** Ask checklist questions via AskUserQuestion
- **Call B:** Produce manifest with user answers
- **Orchestrator:** Get manifest approval — if approved, proceed directly; if changes, invoke Call C
- **Call C (conditional):** Revise manifest, re-approve

### Resuming Stage 2 (intake-brd-review-agent) — via scoped calls

Manifest exists but no FRS yet. Resume using the up-to-3-call scoped pattern (see start.md Step 4b):
- **Call A:** Read inputs, review against FRS template, return gap analysis
- **Orchestrator:** Ask clarifying questions via AskUserQuestion
- **Call B:** Produce FRS with user answers
- **Orchestrator:** Get FRS approval
- **Call C:** Finalize (commit, transition) or revise

## What Happens Next

- DESIGN phase: Ensures all artifacts are in `generated-docs/specs/` — generates missing ones, copies user-provided ones
- Then SCOPE → STORIES → per-story cycle
