Done. I made 4 edits to make rejection reasons required at all levels:

1. **BR-GOV-001** (Three-Level Approval Hierarchy): Changed Level 1 and Level 2 from "(rejection reason optional)" to "(rejection reason REQUIRED)" to match Level 3

2. **BR-GOV-001 Business Rules**: Changed "reason (if provided)" to "reason" and updated "Level 3 rejection requires documented reason" to "Rejection at any level requires documented reason"

3. **BR-GOV-003** (Rejection Workflow): Changed "rejection reason logged (if provided)" to "rejection reason logged (mandatory)"

4. **BR-ROLE-003** (Approver Requirements): Changed "document rejection reasons (mandatory at Level 3)" to "document rejection reasons (mandatory at all levels)"
