I'll start the feature development workflow. Let me first check what feature specifications exist in the `documentation/` directory.

I found the **InvestInsight Portfolio Reporting & Data Stewardship Platform** BRD. This is a comprehensive enterprise application with:

- **Multi-level approval workflows** (3-tier governance)
- **Data management screens** (instruments, index prices, ratings, risk metrics)
- **File import monitoring** dashboards
- **Audit trail** views
- **Role-based** user interfaces (Operations, Analyst, Approver, Administrator)

This feature involves significant UI screens. Let me initialize the workflow state and ask about wireframes.

Bash: Initialize workflow state for DESIGN phase

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

Workflow initialized successfully.

**This feature involves extensive UI:**
- Dashboard views for file status, data validation, workflow progress
- Master data management screens (instruments, prices, ratings, risk metrics, etc.)
- Multi-step approval workflow interfaces
- Audit trail viewers
- Role-specific interfaces (Operations Lead, Analyst, Approver, Administrator)

Would you like me to create **wireframes first** using the ui-ux-designer agent before scoping epics, or proceed directly to **scoping** with the feature-planner?

Creating wireframes first is recommended for UI-heavy features like thisâ€”it helps visualize screens before breaking them into implementation epics and stories.

Now I'll analyze the BRD and propose the screen list for your approval.

## Proposed Screens

Based on the BRD, I've identified the following screens needed for the InvestInsight Portfolio Reporting & Data Stewardship Platform:

### Core Workflow Screens (10 screens)

1. **Dashboard (Role-Based Home...

Task: Create UI wireframes for InvestInsight

_**Agent (model claude-opus-4-5-20251101)**_

The ui-ux-designer has analyzed the BRD and proposes **18 screens** organized as follows:

### Core Workflow Screens (10)
1. **Dashboard (Role-Based Home)** - Pending actions, workflow status, alerts by role
2. **Batch Management** - Create batches, view active batches, switch periods
3. **File Status Monitor** - Expected vs received files across sources
4. **Data Validation Summary** - Completeness checks with drill-down
5. **Approval Review Screen** - Read-only view for approvers with approve/reject
6. **Workflow State Viewer** - Visual workflow stage with history

### Master Data Management Screens (6)
7. **Instrument Master Management** - CRUD with search, filter, audit history
8. **Index Prices Management** - Prices by period, bulk upload, outstanding items
9. **Risk Metrics Management** - Duration/YTM per instrument/batch
10. **Volatility Management** - Instrument beta values
11. **Credit Ratings Management** - Multi-agency ratings, change detection
12. **Custom Holdings Management** - Manual entry for special positions

### Reference Data & Administration Screens (4)
13. **Reference Data Management** - Countries, currencies, portfolios, etc.
14. **User Administration** - User lifecycle management
15. **Role & Permission Management** - Roles, approval authorities
16. **Audit Trail Viewer** - Filterable history with export

### Process Support Screens (2)
17. **File Processing Monitor** - Import details, errors, retry
18. **Calculation Status Monitor** - Calculation execution and failures

Excellent wireframe quality. Here's what was captured in the Approval Review screen:

**Key Features:**
- âœ… Mandatory rejection reason field with validation
- âœ… Read-only data view (same as operations sees)
- âœ… Previous approvals timeline
- âœ… Role-specific review instructions per level
- âœ… Rejection impact warning (clears calculations, resets workflow)
- âœ… Analyst commentary section
- âœ… Business rules documented

---

**Wireframes Complete - Ready for Commit**

All 18 screens are created in [generated-docs/wireframes/](generated-docs/wireframes/) covering:
- Core workflow (Dashboard, Batches, Files, Validation, Approval, Workflow State)
- Master data management (Instruments, Prices, Risk Metrics, Beta, Ratings, Custom Holdings)
- Administration (Reference Data, Users, Roles/Permissions, Audit Trail)
- Process support (File Processing, Calculation Status)

**Do you approve committing these wireframes?** This will:
1. Commit the wireframes to the repository
2. Complete the DESIGN phase
3. Prepare for the SCOPE phase (defining epics)
