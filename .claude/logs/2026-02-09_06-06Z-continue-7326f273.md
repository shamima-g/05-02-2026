Here's the current workflow state:

**Current State:**
- **Epic:** 1 - Authentication, Authorization & User Management
- **Story:** 3 - User Lifecycle Management
- **Phase:** REALIGN

Stories 1 (User Authentication) and 2 (Role-Based Dashboard) are complete. We're about to start Story 3 which covers the admin user management page at `/admin/users` - CRUD operations for users, search/filtering, deactivation/reactivation, and audit trails.

Does this look correct? Should I proceed with the REALIGN phase for Story 3?
