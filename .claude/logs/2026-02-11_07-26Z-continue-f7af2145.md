Here's the current workflow state:

**Current State:**
- **Epic:** 1 - Authentication, Authorization & User Management
- **Story:** 8 of 8 - Login Activity Monitoring
- **Phase:** REALIGN
- **Progress:** Stories 1-7 complete, Story 8 is the last story in this epic

Story 8 covers the Login Activity Report page at `/admin/users/login-activity` with:
- Login attempt history display (timestamps, status, IP, location, user agent)
- Filtering by date range, status, and user
- Security alerts (multiple failed attempts, account lockouts, brute force detection)
- Suspicious activity detection (new location, impossible travel)
- Export to Excel functionality
- Real-time updates

Is this correct? Should I proceed with the **REALIGN** phase for Story 8?
