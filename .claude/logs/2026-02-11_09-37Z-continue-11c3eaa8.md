Now I have a clear picture. Here's the current state:

**Current Workflow State:**
- **Epic 1:** Authentication, Authorization & User Management - **COMPLETE** (8/8 stories done)
- **Epic 2:** Batch Management & Workflow State Control - **STORIES** phase (stories need to be defined)
- **Total Epics:** 6
- **Phase:** STORIES (defining stories for Epic 2)

Epic 1 is fully complete with all 8 stories implemented, reviewed, and verified. The workflow now needs to define the stories for **Epic 2: Batch Management & Workflow State Control**, which covers batch creation, workflow state machine (Data Preparation â†’ L1/L2/L3 Approval â†’ Published), state-based access control, and workflow audit trails.

Is this correct? Should I proceed with the STORIES phase for Epic 2?

Epic 2 stories are created and the workflow state has been updated. Here's the summary:

## Epic 2: Batch Management & Workflow State Control - 8 Stories

| # | Story | Points |
|---|-------|--------|
| 1 | Batch Creation & Listing | 8 |
| 2 | Batch Context Switching | 5 |
| 3 | Workflow State Visualization | 5 |
| 4 | Data Confirmation & Workflow Transition | 5 |
| 5 | State-Based Access Control | 8 |
| 6 | Workflow History & Audit Trail | 8 |
| 7 | Dashboard Pending Actions | 8 |
| 8 | Batch Status Summary | 8 |

**Total: 55 story points**

The workflow has already advanced to **REALIGN for Epic 2, Story 1** (Batch Creation & Listing). Shall I proceed with the REALIGN phase to begin the per-story TDD cycle?
