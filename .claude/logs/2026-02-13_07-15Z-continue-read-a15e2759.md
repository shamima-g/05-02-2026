No `.settings.json` file found at the project root. Let me check for it elsewhere and also get the workflow state.

Here's the current workflow state:

**Current State:**
- **Epic:** 2 - Batch Management & Workflow State Control
- **Story:** 4 - Data Confirmation & Workflow Transition
- **Phase:** REALIGN
- **Progress:** Epic 1 complete (8/8 stories), Epic 2 stories 1-3 complete, stories 4-8 pending
- **Total Epics:** 6

The workflow is ready to perform **REALIGN** for Story 4, which analyzes discovered impacts from Story 3 before proceeding to SPECIFY.

Is this correct? Should I proceed with the REALIGN phase for Epic 2, Story 4?
