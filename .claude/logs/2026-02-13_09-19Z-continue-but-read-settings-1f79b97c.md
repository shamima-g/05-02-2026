/continue but read settings.json first

I'll start by reading the settings.json file as requested, then check the workflow state.

Here's the current workflow state:

---

**Current State:**
- **Epic:** 2 - Batch Management & Workflow State Control
- **Story:** 5 - State-Based Access Control
- **Phase:** REALIGN
- **Progress:** Epic 1 complete (8/8), Epic 2 stories 1-4 complete, stories 5-8 pending
- **Total Epics:** 6

**Settings reviewed:** [settings.json](.claude/settings.json) has permissions (Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep, common Bash patterns, Task) and hooks for logging. [settings.local.json](.claude/settings.local.json) has additional local permissions accumulated from previous sessions.

---

Is this correct? Should I proceed with the **REALIGN** phase for Epic 2, Story 5 (State-Based Access Control)?
